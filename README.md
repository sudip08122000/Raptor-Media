## Features

Raptor Media comes packed with a variety of useful features, including:

- **Secure Authentication:** We use a secure authentication system that allows users to register and log in to the platform. We ensure that the user's password is encrypted and we also use email verification to prevent unauthorized access.

- **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile page that they can customize with their picture, bio, and other information. Users can also view the profiles of others on the platform.

- **Creating Posts:** Users can create posts that can include text, images, and videos. They can also tag other users and add hashtags to their posts.

- **Likes and Comments:** Users can like and comment on posts created by other users. We use a real-time notification system to notify users when someone has liked or commented on their posts.

- **Following Users:** Users can follow other users and view their posts on their feed. They can also see the latest posts from the users they follow.

- **Notifications:** We use a real-time notification system to notify users of new likes, comments, and followers.

- **Privacy and Security:** We take the privacy and security of our users very seriously. We ensure that only the user's followers can see their posts and that all user data is encrypted and secure.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our platform is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. We use a clean and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate the platform easily and find what they are looking for quickly.

## Tools

Raptor Media is built using the MERN stack, featuring the following powerful tools:

- **Next.js:** A popular React framework that provides server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and other performance optimizations.

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows developers to create reusable UI components.

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. It enables developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications. With TypeScript, developers can write more predictable and robust code, and benefit from better code editor support, as well as improved developer experience. TypeScript is widely used in many modern web development frameworks, and it can be integrated with other tools and libraries to enhance the development process.

- **Zustand:** A lightweight state management library for React that provides a simple API for managing global state in your application.

- **Next Auth:** A complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It provides a set of pre-built sign-in pages, as well as a customizable API for authentication and authorization.

- **Prisma:** A modern database toolkit that simplifies database access in your application. It provides an ORM that allows you to interact with your database using a type-safe API.

- **MongoDB:** A popular NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custom user interfaces by composing pre-built CSS classes. It provides a comprehensive set of design primitives that can be combined to create any design.
